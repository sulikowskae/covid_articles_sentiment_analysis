We conducted a sentiment analysis for 2 newspapers: "The Guardian" and "BBC", both for words and for sentences. 
Additionally, we investigated the dispersion of the word "China" for both newspapers.

After that, we built a model that is able to predict from which newspaper is a given sentence. 
Our best classifier (SVM) showed an accuracy score equal to 85% on the test set and almost 90% on the training set. 
Naive Bayes classifier showed an accuracy score equal to 78% on the test set and almost 81% on the training set.
